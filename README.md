# resource-router

![Build](https://github.com/mdvorak/resource-router/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

[Angular](https://angular.io/) routing engine that drive views by media types. It loads data itself, and by response `Content-Type` header
it displays configured view. It is a replacement for original [Angular Router](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html) (they cannot be used at the same time).

The aim of this library is to allow building of RESTful clients using Angular, following [HATEOAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) principle.

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for release changes.

## Installation

    npm i angular-resource-router --save
    
## Documentation

See [API documentation](https://mdvorak.github.io/resource-router/) for latest released version.


## Configuration

Sample snippet how is the router configured.
It is very similar to original router, but instead of registering paths, we are registering media types.

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { ResourceRouterModule } from 'angular-resource-router';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { SampleComponent } from './sample.component';
import { ErrorComponent } from './error.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    SampleComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ResourceRouterModule.configure({
      prefix: 'api/'
    }),
    ResourceRouterModule.forTypes([
      {
        type: 'application/x.sample',
        component: SampleComponent
      },
      {
        status: '*',
        type: '*',
        component: ErrorComponent
      }
    ])
  ],
  bootstrap: [
    AppComponent
  ]
})
export class ExampleModule {
}
```

## How It Works

TODO

## Development

Before development, run
```
npm run bootstrap
```
it will create necessary symlinks for build to pass.

_Note: Under linux, you need to change global npm prefix to user accessible directory, see [How to Prevent Permissions Errors](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions)._

### Library

Build of the library is performed with
```
npm run build
```

### Publishing

To publish new library version to [npm repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-resource-router): 

1. Verify/set library version in `src/lib/package.json`
1. Make sure there are release notes in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).
1. Commit and push changes, if any
1. Create a new [release on GitHub](https://github.com/mdvorak/resource-router/releases),
   in the format `v0.0.0` (or alternatively use git directly)
1. Copy changelog markdown text to the release
1. Build the library and make sure all tests passed
   ```
   npm run bootstrap
   npm run build
   ```
1. Verify library is built correctly using
   ```
   npm run buildapp
   ```
1. Publish the library
   ```
   npm publish dist/angular-resource-router
   ```
1. Publish docs, if this is head release
   ```
   npm run ghpages
   ```
   _Note: For this command to succeed, you must have ssh agent running at the background._
1. Merge the branches if needed

### Demo app

Local development server can be started with
```
npm start
```
