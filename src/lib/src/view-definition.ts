   * Wildcard character '*' is also supported, but has different meaning than usual - expression is still
   * expanded to 3 characters. Which means, '2*' == '2??', and '*' == '???'.
   * It might be array of values, handling multiple disjunct values.

   * and one wildcard as the fallback view.
   *
   * If undefined, it is calculated from type by following rules:
   * * Type equal to '*' has quality of `0.0`.
   * * Type with any wildcard has quality of `0.5`
   * * Type without wildcard has quality of `1.0`.
   *
   * Number of wildcard characters is insignificant.
   *
   * Otherwise it maintains order of definition (note that you should never rely on this across modules).
   *
   * It is recommended to define views with low quality (wildcards) only on application module level, domain-specific modules
   * should always match domain-specific types. Defining it all across application makes it hard to maintain and application
   * behavior might be non-deterministic.
   *
   * Example:
   * TODO show how same wildcards are treated and how to override quality.
